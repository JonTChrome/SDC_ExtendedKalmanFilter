# Extended Kalman Filter

# Overview
This project is a C++ implementation of an Extended Kalman Filter for fusing measurements from Radar and Lidar sensors.  This implementation is used to predict the position and velocity of an object given different sensor measurements taken over some time period.  The base project with dependecy info and build instructions can found [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Extended-Kalman-Filter-Project).  The project contains two datasets which contain sensor data for the position and velocity in the x and y directions as well as a timestamp.  The two datasets are mirror images of each other reflected over the y-axis.
